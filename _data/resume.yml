    header: "Full-stack software engineer with wide experience in many technologies and languages."
    text: "I am following T-shaped skills model - I mostly excited about Scala (Akka, Play!) so I spend much time working with it. I am also keeping up in C and Node.js trends and can start working with them very quickly. I read some news and watch videos about other technologies from time to time to have wide area of thought (Python, PHP, Perl), but I do not use them every day. I am free to use Linux, Mac OS or Windows and ready to work with Git, Jenkins, Bugzilla, Redmine, Jira, Bamboo, Trello, GitHub or BitBucket. Ready for relocation (Europe or US)."
